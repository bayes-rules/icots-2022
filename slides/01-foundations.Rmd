class: middle 

## Chapter 1 Goals

- Learn to __think like a Bayesian__
- Explore the __foundations of a Bayesian data analysis__ and how they __contrast with the frequentist alternative__
- Learn a little bit about the __history of the Bayesian philosophy__

---

class: middle 

## Chapter 2 Goals

- Explore __probability tools__: marginal, conditional, and joint probability models and the Binomial model
- Conduct your __first formal Bayesian analysis!__ Construct your first prior and likelihood models and, posterior models via Bayes’ Rule
- Practice your __Bayesian grammar__. Practice the formal notation and terminology central to Bayesian grammar
- __Simulate Bayesian models__. Conduct your first simulation using R

---

class: middle 

## Chapter 3 Goals

- __Interpret and tune a continuous Beta prior__ model to reflect your prior information about  $\pi$
- Interpret and communicate __features of prior and posterior models__ using properties such as mean, mode, and variance
- Construct the __fundamental Beta-Binomial__ model for proportion $\pi$

---

class: middle 

## Chapter 4 Goals

- Explore the balanced __influence of the prior and data on the posterior__. 
- Explore one of the coolest features of Bayesian analysis: how a __posterior model evolves as it’s updated with new data__

---

class: middle 

## Chapter 5 Goals


- Build Bayesian models by practicing how to __recognize kernels and make use of proportionality__
- Familiarize yourself with conjugacy. You will learn about what makes a __prior conjugate and why this is a helpful property__
