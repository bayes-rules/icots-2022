```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


We have provided `.Rmd` file for this activity, if you prefer to use R file please run `knitr::purl("R/03-regression.Rmd", "R/03-regression.R")` in the Console.
If you are using `.Rmd` we recommend that you avoid knitting often and rely more on `Run Current Chunk` feature, as it will take some time to run the models.
